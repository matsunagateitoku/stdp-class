# Class 5: Clustering Documents With Unsupervised Machine Learning
## Section 1: Use Metrics To Determine Text Similarity
| Lesson          |         Discription                                | Colab link    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|------|
| **Module Introduction: Use Metrics To Determine Text Similarity**   | - become familiar with two major similarity measures: lexical and semantic similarity  
                                                                        - practice evaluating the similarity between words by computing the distance 
                                                                        - virus identification and spell-check problems using the Hamming and Levenshtein distance metrics           
                                                                        - Measuring the similarity between words in this module will prepare you for the document categorization     |  |
