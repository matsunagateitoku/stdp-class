    "[Hamming distance](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.hamming.html) can be considered the opposite of similarity. In two sequences of equal length, it counts the number of positions that corresponding characters are different. Just like Jaccard similarity, Hamming distance works on elements of any data type. Just like correlation, it requires sequences to be the same length. If sequence lengths mismatch, it will return an infinity or [`np.inf`](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/constants.html#numpy.inf) non-numeric value. \n",
