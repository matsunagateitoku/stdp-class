    "<span style=\"color:black\">[Collocations](https://www.nltk.org/howto/collocations.html#collocations) is an expression of commonly co-occuring words. Recall that we could use frequency of occurrence to find representative n-grams. With collocations we can also use metrics that account for word importance. A popular measure is pointwise mutual information ([PMI](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.metrics.association.html#module-nltk.metrics.association)), which is a degree of increased information from the additional word in the phrase, regardless of word order:\n",

Note that $p$ functions are theoretical probabilities, which, in practice, can be approximated in a multitude of ways (each requiring a set of specific assumptions).\n",
    "        \n",
    "You can say that PMI measures the amount of mutual information in its arguments, $x$ and $y$, after their unique information is factored out (through division). A higher PMI suggests a smaller chance of two words coincidentally occuring in the same phrase. PMI and raw frequency counts are available in the `nltk.collocations` library. An implemented approach of estimation of these probabilities can be discovered in [Manning and Schutze 5.3.4](https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2014-15/W/6339/_media/chap5.pdf#page=23) and is beyond the scope of this course.\n",

The chart shows where most matches appear (see legend coloring). The yellowest colors appear at the bottom of the chart indicating that low values of `minChar` (vertical axis) associate with high values of `nMatches` (representing collocations). Collocations do not appear too sensitive to `minFreq`, but lower `minFreq` has greater collocations for higher `minChar`. If we want to produce most collocations, we would choose any value of `minFreq` and <4 values of `minChar`.\n",
