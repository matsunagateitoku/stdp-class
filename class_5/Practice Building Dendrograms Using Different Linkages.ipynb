Then rows with movie titles starting with a letter `'Y'` are retrieved. This returns about 27 movies - sufficient for demonstration of different types of dendrograms. More observations will overplot the plots making them unusable for discussion or analysis. Naturally, in a production setting, you will need to similarly subsample your observations so that visualizations are not overplotted and can be meaningfully analyzed."

The next lower threshold has a similar problem. Identifying a \"good\" threshold is difficult because the nodes of the tree are located in a narrow horizontal band and are difficult to split consistently and unambiguously with a threshold.
