    "<span style=\"color:black\">Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful technique for compressing dimensions under specific constraints. Simply said, PCA is a dimension reduction technique, which you will use here to approximate 768 dimensions with just two dimensions. Here, you use it to rotate the movie vectors such that the first dimension (or first principal component, PC1) captures most of the variability in embedding coefficients of the movie vectors. Then, PC2 captures most of the remaining variability and so on. All but the first to principal components, which are needed for 2D plotting, are ignored.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:black\">While the theory behind PCA can be fairly exciting and involved, its application is straight forward. You create a `PCA()` object and specify the desired number of  PCs to return. Then, the object is fitted on the matrix `dfEmb` and 62 rows are returned with two columns. These columns are called $x$ and $y$, and are coordinates of each movie on a 2D plane."
