    "[**Jaccard similarity**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#jaccard-similarity-score) produces a similarity score in the interval $[0,1]$, where 0 indicates no similarity and 1 indicates perfect similarity. This works on any two sets of numbers, characters, words, objects, etc., and computes an intersection set of distinct shared elements $I$ along with the union set of all distinct elements $U$. The Jaccard similarity is just $|I|/|U|$, or the fraction of the sets' cardinalities. This computes the fraction of overlap of two sets. \n",
