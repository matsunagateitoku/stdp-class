# Conducting Semantic and Sentiment Analysis
Course Description
We have all been misunderstood when sending a text message or email, as tone often does not translate well in written communication. Similarly, computers can have a hard time discerning the meaning of words if they are being used sarcastically, such as when we say “Great weather” when it’s raining. If you are automatically processing reviews of your product, a negative review will have many of the same key words as a positive one, so you will need to be able to train a model to distinguish between a good review and a bad review. This is where semantic and sentiment analysis come in.

In this course, you will examine many kinds of semantic relationships that words can have (such as hypernyms, hyponyms, or meronyms), which go a long way toward extracting the meaning of documents at scale. You will also implement named entity recognition to identify proper nouns within a document and use several techniques to determine the sentiment of text: Is the tone positive or negative? These invaluable skills can easily turn the tide in a difficult project for your team at work or on the path toward achieving your personal goals.

| **Module Intro**   | One way to compare the contents of many texts is by examining their vocabularies. However, even texts relating to the same topic may not include the exact same set of words — synonyms, part of speech variations, and the use of broad versus specific terms can make it challenging to compare textual vocabulary alone. The process of semantic analysis can help provide insight into the meaning, or sense, behind terms, as well as the relationship between different terms. A computer can then use these relationships to compare document content and categorize documents at scale. | In this module, you will be introduced to many types of lexical semantic relationships, which you will practice retrieving in Python using the lexical database WordNet. Then, you will use these relationships to compare various texts and evaluate their similarity.
